# covid-19-us-seroprevalence-model

This document provides replication code and data for our US model of covid-19 infections. The R script estimates the level of infections in the country in any given week, with primitives from the CDC (deaths by age and gender, and estimated time between infection and death), official case data from John Hopkins CSSE, and the study "Age-specific mortality and immunity patterns of SARS-CoV-2" by Megan Oâ€™Driscoll et al (2020). 

To replicate our analysis, clone this repository to your local computer and run "DC_us_seropositivity_model_rep.R".
